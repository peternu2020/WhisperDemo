    "what strikes me about the crucifixion is that some idiot tried to buy this for 100 Bitcoin that's almost $800,000 absolutely insane I don't understand it",
    "what's really interesting to me about this crucifixion painting is that there is this little bird with a nest on the top and I keep trying to figure out what that's trying to symbolize is the bird God and he is guarding over his children by sending his one and only son Jesus Christ to die for our sins or is the bird Mary Magdalene who's also you know that her son go off and die for this purpose so that's that's a really interesting question for me",
